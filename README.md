# Bees!

## A quick, fun and easy quiz app for learning about bees and wildlife conservation.

###Features
* Dynamic single-page web application.
* Randomly generates quizzes for users to attempt and saves their scores.
* ReactJS front end for intuitive UI.
* Redux for centralized state control.
* Ruby on Rails back end with PostgreSQL database for managing user data.


### [Back End Repo Here](https://github.com/FrankGerold/bees-backend "Bees Back-End")

### Installation
In order for the app to have full functionality, the back-end server should be running already. (Details in the repo listed above.)

All that is required for the frontend is an installation of NodeJS and a package manager such as NPM or Yarn.

From the base bees-frontend directory in your shell of choice, run a simple `npm install`, followed by `yarn start` and the app should be running in your browser at [localhost:3000](localhost:3000) or whichever port it tells you!
